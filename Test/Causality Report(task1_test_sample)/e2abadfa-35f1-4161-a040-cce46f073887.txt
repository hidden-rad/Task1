Causal Exploration:
 The patient's symptoms of a productive cough and subjective fever for the past 5 days with worsening pain with coughing (A4) do not correlate with any observed acute intrathoracic process (A1). The findings indicate that the lungs, despite low volumes, appear clear with no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax (A2). Therefore, the normal cardiomediastinal silhouette and intact osseous structures (A3) suggest that the symptoms could be due to a non-intrathoracic source.
