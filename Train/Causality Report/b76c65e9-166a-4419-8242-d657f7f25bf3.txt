Causal Exploration:
The finding of cardiomegaly suggests an enlargement of the heart involving the Right Atrium, Left Atrium, Right Ventricle, and Left Ventricle. This could potentially be responsible for the unchanged cardiomediastinal contours observed in the report. The presence of cardiomegaly, as indicated by a cardiothoracic ratio over 50%, could imply that the cardiac size is contributing to the observed mediastinal contours. The consistent right rib fractures could also be affecting the cardiomediastinal contours indirectly by altering the chest wall structure.
