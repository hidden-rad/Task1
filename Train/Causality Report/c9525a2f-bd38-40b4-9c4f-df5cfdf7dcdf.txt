Causal Exploration:** The finding of edema (A4) in the right lower lobe (RLL) and left lower lobe (LLL) (A2) at locations {2, 11} (A3) indicates that the widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality noted may be related to non-cardiogenic causes. This suggests that the heterogeneity observed could be due to factors such as interstitial pulmonary emphysema or other non-cardiogenic sources.
