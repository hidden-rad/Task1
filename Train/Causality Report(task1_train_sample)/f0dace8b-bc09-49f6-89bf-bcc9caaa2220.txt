Causal Exploration: The findings suggest a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion, which are consistent with the post-surgical state and the potential complications such as localized hemorrhage or infection. The location of the worsening opacity in the right lower lobe and the band-like areas of atelectasis in both lower lobes align with the expected post-operative changes. Additionally, the possible small pleural effusions bilaterally further support the presence of pleural involvement.
