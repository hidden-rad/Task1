Causal Exploration: The improvement in the bilateral alveolar and interstitial pattern suggests a reduction in pulmonary edema. This is supported by the finding that the pleural effusions, which are a common consequence of edema, are also improving. The larger size of the effusion on the left side compared to the right is consistent with the presence of pleural effusion in the left pleural space. The absence of pneumothorax indicates no new complications arising from the treatment or condition.
