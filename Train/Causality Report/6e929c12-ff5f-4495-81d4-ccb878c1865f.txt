Causal Exploration: The patient's history of pancreatic cancer and ongoing chemotherapy can lead to a compromised immune system. This immune suppression may result in fever, as noted in the patient's indication. Despite this, the chest radiographs show no acute intrathoracic process, which suggests that the fever is not due to a respiratory infection or other thoracic complications.
