Causal Exploration:
Finding pleural effusion (A1) was documented, located at the Left Pleural (A2), with coordinates {10, 10} (A3). This finding, called pleural effusion (A4), shows an unchanged evidence of left pleural effusion, better appreciated on the lateral radiograph. The chronic effusion located within the left fissure correlates with the increased radiodensity observed.
