Causal Exploration:

The findings of left pleural effusion and prominent interstitial lung markings in the left lung indicate the presence of pleural effusion and metastasis. The unchanged condition of the left-sided volume loss and the prominent interstitial lung markings suggest a stable state without significant interval change. The observation of lymphangitic spread of metastasis aligns with the presence of an abnormally increased density area in the left lung. The absence of significant changes in the right lung and the inability to accurately assess the heart and mediastinum further support the stable findings.
