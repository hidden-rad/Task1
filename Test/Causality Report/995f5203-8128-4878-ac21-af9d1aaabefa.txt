 Finding pleural effusion in the right pleural space is indicated by the indeterminate volume of pleural fluid in the right hemithorax. The location information correlates with the right pleural area. The pleural effusion is likely contributing to the observed right lung collapse, which mirrors the findings described in the QA5 list.
