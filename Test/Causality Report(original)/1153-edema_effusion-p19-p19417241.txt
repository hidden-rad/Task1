Causal Exploration:

The cardiomediastinal silhouette's stability and absence of large effusion suggest there is no significant cardiomegaly. However, the mild pulmonary edema previously noted might have been influenced by the cardiovascular condition. Given that there is no new consolidation and the improvement of pulmonary edema, the assessment of cardiac size and position aligns with the findings that the cardiothoracic ratio is within normal range. The stable silhouette also correlates with the normal diameters of the aortic knob and pulmonary arteries, further supporting the absence of significant cardiomegaly or other major cardiac abnormalities.
