Causal Exploration: The left lower lobe collapse is indicative of atelectasis, which is characterized by asymmetry and an abnormally increased density area in the lung zones. Concurrently, the pleural effusion in the left lower lobe is evidenced by the blunting of the costophrenic angle. Linear atelectasis in the right middle lobe and lower lobe suggests a partial collapse, which does not show blunted costophrenic angles. These findings explain the absence of pneumothorax and right pleural effusion.
