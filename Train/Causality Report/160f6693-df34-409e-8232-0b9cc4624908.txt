CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The patient experienced a fall following electrocution, leading to the examination. The trauma board obscured parts of the radiograph, but no signs of pulmonary contusion, effusion, or pneumothorax were found. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains normal, and there are no displaced fractures. Consequently, no acute intrathoracic process is identified.
