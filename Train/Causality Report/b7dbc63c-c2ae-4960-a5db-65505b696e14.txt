Causal Exploration: The increased interstitial markings predominantly on the right side could indicate pulmonary edema, which is a condition characterized by excess fluid in the lungs. This fluid accumulation can cause difficulty in breathing and is often associated with conditions like heart failure or fluid overload. The absence of large confluent consolidation and the unchanged cardiomediastinal silhouette further support the likelihood of pulmonary edema over other differential diagnoses.
