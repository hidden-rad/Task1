Causal Exploration:
 The presence of pleural effusion was identified in both the right and left pleural spaces, indicated by blunting of the left costophrenic angle and unchanged small right pleural effusion. This suggests that the patient has pleural effusions located in the Left Pleural and Right Pleural regions, respectively.
