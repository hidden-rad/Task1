Causal Exploration:
The finding of cardiomegaly is noted with an increased cardiothoracic ratio over 50, indicating an enlarged heart. The accentuated transverse diameter of the heart suggests cardiomegaly, which is likely exacerbated by low lung volumes. The pleural fluid and atelectatic changes at the left lung base further contribute to the observed opacification and poor definition of the hemidiaphragms.
