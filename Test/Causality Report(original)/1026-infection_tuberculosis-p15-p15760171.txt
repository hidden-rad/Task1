Causal Exploration: The patient presented with a non-productive cough after starting Orencia infusion, raising concerns about a possible pulmonary infiltrate. However, the chest radiographs show no evidence of intrathoracic malignancy, infection, or cardiac issues. This suggests that the cough is not due to any detectable abnormalities in the heart, lungs, or pleural surfaces.
