CAUSAL EXPLORATION:

The finding of linear atelectasis in the right middle lobe corresponds to the A1 finding of atelectasis in the A4 list. The location information of the finding aligns with the A2 location, specifically the RLL (Right Lower Lobe), and the specific sections {9, 10} match the broader description of atelectasis in the MIMIC report.
