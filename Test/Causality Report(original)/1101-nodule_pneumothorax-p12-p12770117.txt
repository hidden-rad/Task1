Causal Exploration: The prominent bilateral opacities and pleural thickening at the right apex could be indicative of pneumonia or pleural effusion. The blunting of the costophrenic angle suggests the presence of pleural effusion. The relative sparing of the right mid/upper zone with opacities more prominent in the lower lobes may be indicative of pneumonia located in the Right Lower Lobe (RLL) and Left Lower Lobe (LLL).
