Causal Exploration:

The presence of cardiomegaly indicates that the heart size is enlarged beyond normal limits. This condition can lead to interstitial pulmonary edema, which is reflected by the abnormal branching of lung vessels and the presence of extra lines in the periphery. The small bilateral pleural effusions are consistent with fluid accumulation in the pleural space, which is another consequence of cardiomegaly and associated edema.
