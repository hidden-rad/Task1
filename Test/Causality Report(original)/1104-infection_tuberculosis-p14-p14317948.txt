CAUSAL EXPLORATION:

Granulomatous lymph node calcifications are identified in the left hilus and lower mediastinum, which could be due to previous tuberculosis. The specific location of the granuloma is the Left Hilum with coordinates {5, 6}. This finding indicates a past infection but no evidence of active infection is present. Furthermore, there is no pleural abnormality observed. This implies that the granuloma, while indicative of an old infection, does not currently contribute to any pleural complications.
