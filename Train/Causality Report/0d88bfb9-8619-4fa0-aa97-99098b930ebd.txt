CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The finding of a granuloma in the left mid lung (A1) is located in the left upper lobe (A2) and specifically at the fifth rib (A3). This granuloma appears as a nodular focus of high density (A4), which may be attributed to a calcified parenchymal granuloma or a bone island. The presence of this granuloma does not seem to affect the overall lung fields, which appear clear, and there is no indication of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
