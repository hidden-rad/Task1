Causal Exploration: 

The examination (A1) revealed that the lungs are free of focal consolidations, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax (A4). Additionally, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits, and no acute osseous abnormalities are identified (A4). The location information of the findings (A2 and A3) pertain to the chest radiograph performed with PA and lateral views. Consequently, the impression is that there is no radiographic evidence of tuberculosis, directly correlating with the lack of abnormalities found in the lungs and mediastinum.
