Causal Exploration: The findings of mild pneumomediastinum and worsening atelectasis are indicated by the curvilinear lucency around the cardiomediastinal contours and increased left retrocardiac opacity, respectively. The atelectasis is observed in the left lower lobe and right middle lobe, correlating with the locations noted. These findings are consistent with the presence of atelectasis and pneumomediastinum.
