Causal Exploration:
 The patient's history of worsening seizures (A4) prompted the chest radiograph. The findings (A1) indicate a normal heart size and clear lungs with no signs of pleural effusion or pneumothorax (A2). The mildly tortuous thoracic aorta and unremarkable hilar contours (A3) suggest no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. This causal exploration ties the patientâ€™s worsening seizures to the necessity for radiographic imaging to rule out any cardiopulmonary abnormalities that might contribute to or exacerbate their condition.
