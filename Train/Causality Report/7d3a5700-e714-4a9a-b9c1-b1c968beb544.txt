Causal Exploration:
The findings of severe cardiomegaly are associated with increased cardiothoracic ratio, which exceeds 50%. This enlargement of the heart likely contributes to the mild pulmonary vascular congestion observed. Furthermore, the presence of small bilateral pleural effusions is consistent with the pleural effusion finding. The combined presence of cardiomegaly and congestion suggests a possible underlying cardiac condition exacerbating fluid accumulation in the lungs and pleural spaces.
