CAUSAL EXPLORATION:

 The patient presented with fever and cough. Upon examination, the heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours, and pulmonary vasculature were all found to be normal. The lungs were clear with no pleural effusion or pneumothorax observed, and there were no acute osseous abnormalities. These findings indicate that there is no acute cardiopulmonary process. The examination results suggest that the symptoms of fever and cough are not due to any acute cardiopulmonary conditions.
