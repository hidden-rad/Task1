Causal Exploration: The presence of pneumothorax (finding pneumothorax) indicates that air has accumulated in the pleural space, leading to partial lung collapse. The location of the pneumothorax in the left upper lobe (LUL) and its size (approximately 7.4 cm in greatest dimension) are significant. The mild rightward mediastinal shift observed on the expiratory view suggests a moderate to large pneumothorax, which can cause displacement of mediastinal structures due to the pressure difference. The absence of mediastinal shift on inspiratory view further confirms the dynamic nature of the pneumothorax, which may fluctuate with respiratory cycles.
