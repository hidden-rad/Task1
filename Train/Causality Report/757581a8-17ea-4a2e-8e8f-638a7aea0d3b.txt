CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The absence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax, along with a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette and unremarkable upper abdomen, indicates that there are no acute cardiopulmonary issues. This finding suggests that the history of multiple myeloma has not led to any observable infiltrate or pneumonitis in the current radiographs.
