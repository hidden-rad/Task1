Causal Exploration:

The finding of a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette and well-aerated lungs without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax (A1) was noted. The location information of these findings was identified in the chest radiographs (A2 and A3). These findings indicate that there is no acute cardiopulmonary process or significant interval change, providing a causal explanation for the patient's new dyspnea on exertion.
