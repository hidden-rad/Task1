CAUSAL EXPLORATION:

The left pleural effusion is noted in the left lower lobe (LLL) and left pleural regions, which typically presents with a blunted costophrenic angle. This effusion is contributing to the opacity observed in the retrocardiac area. Further imaging may help to delineate whether the mass is within the lung or associated with the pleural effusion.
