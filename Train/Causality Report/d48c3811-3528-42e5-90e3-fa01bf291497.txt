Causal Exploration:**

The presence of edema in the left upper lobe (LUL) and right upper lobe (RUL) is consistent with the noted new interstitial abnormalities. This suggests that the fluid accumulation is likely due to cardiogenic causes given the distribution. However, the lack of an increase in heart size and absence of dilated mediastinal veins point toward alternative diagnoses such as drug-related transfusion edema or diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage.
