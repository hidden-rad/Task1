Causal Exploration: The finding of a mild superior endplate compression deformity at T11 (A1) is stable from prior imaging (A2), and this location information of the finding is confirmed to be T11 (A3). The absence of acute intrathoracic process (A4) indicates that there are no immediate complications or new findings in the thoracic region.
