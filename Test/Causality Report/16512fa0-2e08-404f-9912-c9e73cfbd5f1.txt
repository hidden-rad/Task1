Causal Exploration: Upon tracing the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, the blunting observed is indicative of pleural effusion. This effusion is localized primarily in the left pleural region, between rib spaces 6 and 10. The presence of left basilar atelectasis may also be contributing to the observed pleural effusion.
