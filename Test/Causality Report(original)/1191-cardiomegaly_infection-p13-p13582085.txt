Causal Exploration:
The finding of pleural effusion is noted as small bilateral pleural effusions. This was identified in the left and right pleural locations, with specific attention to the areas at {10, 12}. The causal exploration of these findings includes the trace of the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, noting blunting of the costophrenic angle.
