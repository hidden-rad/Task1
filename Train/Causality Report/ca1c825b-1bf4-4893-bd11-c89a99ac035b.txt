Causal Exploration:
 The relative enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and increased bronchovascular markings are likely secondary to low lung volumes. The low lung volumes obscure the left lower lung zone with the cardiac silhouette, making it challenging to detect any definite signs of pneumonia. This suggests that the low lung volumes are causally related to the observed findings in the chest radiograph.
