Causal Exploration: The moderate cardiomegaly is noted to be stable, which suggests that the heart size has not increased beyond the cardiothoracic ratio of 50%. This finding is consistent with the unchanged status of the heart size, indicating no new pathological enlargement of the heart chambers such as the left ventricle, right ventricle, left atrium, or right atrium. The stability of cardiomegaly further implies that there is no significant change in the mediastinal width or the diameters of the aortic arch and pulmonary trunk, remaining within normal limits.
