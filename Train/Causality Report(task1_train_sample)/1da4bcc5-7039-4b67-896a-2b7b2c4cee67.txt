Causal Exploration: The finding of pleural effusion is located in the right pleural and left pleural spaces. The finding of pneumonia is noted with abnormally increased density in the right lower lobe. These findings are consistent with the noted bibasilar opacities, indicating a combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis that have increased on the right. The stable bilateral pleural effusions support the unchanged nature of the pleural effusions from the prior study.
