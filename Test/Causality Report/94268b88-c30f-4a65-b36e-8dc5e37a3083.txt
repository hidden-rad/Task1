Causal Exploration: The linear atelectasis in the right mid zone and the minimal atelectasis at the left base medially are consistent with atelectasis findings localized in the Right Middle Lobe (RML) and Right Lower Lobe (RLL). These areas (6, 11) correspond to the abnormally increased density observed when comparing the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones. The presence of volume loss on the right and slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm further supports the presence of atelectasis in these regions.

Equivocal slight interval increase in opacity at the right lung base, question due to interval increase in pleural thickening versus technical differences. No discrete focal infiltrate. No consolidation. No other pleural fluid or thickening.

Possible minimal atelectasis at left base medially.

Deformity of ribs at the right lung apex, again noted, unchanged over multiple prior imaging studies.
