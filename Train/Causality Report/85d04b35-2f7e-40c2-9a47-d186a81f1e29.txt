Causal Exploration: The minimal left lower lung atelectasis can be correlated with the finding of increased density area in the left lower lobe. This is evident as the atelectasis is indicated in the location information of the left lower lobe (LLL) and the specific reference to the area {8, 11} where the abnormal density is observed.
