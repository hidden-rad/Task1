Causal Exploration:
The presence of moderate-volume left pleural effusion and severe left lower lobe atelectasis indicates complications following the esophagectomy. The atelectasis is likely a result of partial lung collapse due to the effusion compressing the lung tissue, leading to areas of increased density observed in radiological findings. The unchanged nature of these conditions over several days suggests persistent issues that have not resolved, potentially requiring further medical intervention.
