Causal Exploration: The finding, which is the clear appearance of the lungs without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax, is noted as A1. The location of this finding is indicated in the chest radiograph report, which is A2. The information about the finding is described in the "FINDINGS" section of the report, which is A3. Therefore, the words in the list relevant to A4 are in the "FINDINGS" and "IMPRESSION" sections. This causal exploration links the clear lungs in the radiograph to the conclusion of no pneumonia, explaining the rationale behind the final impression.
