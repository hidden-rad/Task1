Causal Exploration: Atelectasis found in the left upper lobe (LUL) at locations {4, 7} suggests that the left lung, specifically in the perihilar and retrocardiac areas, is not as well expanded or similar in volume compared to the right lung. This atelectasis could be causing the observed abnormalities in lung density and volume symmetry, possibly related to the recent removal of the chest tube and the presence of the PICC line.
