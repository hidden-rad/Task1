Causal Exploration: The increasing opacification at the bases, especially on the right, indicates the presence of pleural effusion, which is located in the right pleural space as observed at the levels of the 8th and 9th ribs. This finding is consistent with the progressive hypoxia noted in the patient's history, likely due to the volume loss in the lower lung caused by the effusion.
