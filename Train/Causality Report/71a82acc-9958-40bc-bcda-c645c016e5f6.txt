Causal Exploration: The finding of no definite radiographic evidence of acute pneumonia or hilar adenopathy (A1), was determined through the chest examination (PA and LAT) (A4). The location information of the nodular opacifications being in the lungs (A2) and the comparison study (A3) both support this conclusion. The suggestion that these nodular opacifications could represent early vessels on-end explains the absence of vascular congestion.
