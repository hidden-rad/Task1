CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The similar appearance of known right upper lung, right hilar, and left chest wall masses is consistent with the observation that one lung is not prominently larger than the other and both hilum are good inverted C-shape. The abnormal density noted along the right hilum aligns with the finding of increased density areas when comparing the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones in turn. The heart size being within normal limits is supported by the assessment that the cardiothoracic ratio does not exceed 50 and is in the normal range. The emphysematous changes with relative lucency of upper lung zones correlate with the symmetrical comparison of these zones.

IMPRESSION:
1. Similar appearance of known right upper lung, right hilar, and left chest wall masses.
2. No evidence of superimposed consolidation.
