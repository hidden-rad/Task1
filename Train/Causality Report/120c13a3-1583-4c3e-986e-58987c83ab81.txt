Causal Exploration:
The significant increased opacity in the left hemithorax is indicative of pleural effusion. This finding is located in the left pleural area, and the measurement {2, 10} further supports the presence of pleural effusion. The placement of the left chest tube is associated with this increased opacity, possibly due to the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space.

IMPRESSION: 
 
Worsening opacity in the left hemithorax status post left chest tube placement.  Findings concerning for worsening hemothorax.  IR consultation advised.
