CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The generalized weakness (A4) prompted the examination (A1). The findings (A2) revealed that the lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or cardiac abnormality (A3). Therefore, it can be concluded that the generalized weakness is not caused by an acute cardiopulmonary process as no abnormalities were found in the chest imaging.
