CAUSAL EXPLORATION:
The presence of bilateral right-greater-than-left effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation suggests pleural effusion and potential pneumonia. These findings correlate with the increased temperature and yellow secretions reported, indicating a likely infectious process. The absence of new infiltrates and the unchanged cardiomediastinal silhouette further support the chronic nature of the pleural effusion and its association with underlying conditions such as CHF.
