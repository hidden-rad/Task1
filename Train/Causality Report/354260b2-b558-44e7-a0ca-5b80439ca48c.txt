CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The finding of pleural effusion is located at the right pleural area as indicated by the blunting of the right costophrenic angle. This suggests the presence of a pleural effusion at the specific location {10, 12}. Additionally, the cardiac silhouette's enlargement, in the absence of vascular congestion, supports the presence of pleural effusion without associated acute cardiac or pulmonary conditions.
