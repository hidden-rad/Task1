Causal Exploration: The evaluation was prompted by the diagnosis of AML and the presence of a pneumothorax post-central line placement (A4). The portable AP radiograph was used to find the current state of the internal jugular line and the presence of any complications (A1). The finding of the right internal jugular line tip at the level of low SVC was noted (A2), along with the observation that there was no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax (A3).
