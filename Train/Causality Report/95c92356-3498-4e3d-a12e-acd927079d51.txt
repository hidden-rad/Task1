Causal Exploration:
 
 The finding of no focal airspace consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax indicates overall normal lung and cardiac function. The degenerative change in the mid thoracic spine with no acute bony abnormality appreciated suggests that the weight loss is unlikely due to an acute musculoskeletal issue. This supports the clinical indication of investigating the 60lb weight loss and querying a mass, as no immediate thoracic abnormalities were detected that would explain the weight loss.
