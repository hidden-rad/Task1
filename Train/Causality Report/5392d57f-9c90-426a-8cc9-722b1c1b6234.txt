Causal Exploration:
 The finding of clear lungs and normal pulmonary vasculature (A1) indicates there is no acute pulmonary issue. The productive cough (A4) does not appear to be caused by any abnormalities visible on the chest X-ray. The heart size being top normal and no pleural effusion or pneumothorax (A2 and A3) further support the conclusion of no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. This suggests that the productive cough might be due to a non-cardiopulmonary cause.
