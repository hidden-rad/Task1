Causal Exploration: The stable mild cardiomegaly, identified as an enlargement of the heart, involves the right atrium, left atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle. This condition is not showing progression, indicating that the heart chambers' enlargement has not worsened. The pulmonary vasculature engorgement could be related to the heart's inability to effectively pump blood, causing a back-up in the pulmonary circulation. This stable condition suggests that the cardiothoracic ratio is over 50%, affirming the enlargement's presence but without further increase in size.
