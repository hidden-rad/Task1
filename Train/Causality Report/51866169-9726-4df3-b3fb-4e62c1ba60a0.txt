Causal Exploration: The patientâ€™s history of gastric tumor resection and current LUQ/rib pain prompted the chest PA and lateral radiographs (A1). The findings indicate the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits, and the lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax (A2). No displaced rib fractures were identified (A3). Therefore, the final impression is that there is no acute cardiopulmonary process or displaced rib fractures (A4). If the rib pain persists, further dedicated rib radiographs are recommended for a more detailed evaluation of a potential fracture.
