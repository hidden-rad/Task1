Causal Exploration: Finding pleural effusion (A1) is confirmed on the right side (A2), and it is located at coordinates {5, 8} (A3). This corresponds to the right pleural effusion (A4) noted in the report. The causal factors include the patientâ€™s history of RLL tumor and bronchial stent placement, which likely contributed to the pleural effusion. The improvement in the right lung ventilation is indicative of the therapeutic effect of the bronchial stents.
