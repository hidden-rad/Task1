Causal Exploration: The finding of cardiomegaly indicates an enlargement of the heart, observed specifically in the left ventricle, right ventricle, left atrium, and right atrium. The observed lower lung volumes contribute to the appearance of an enlarged heart and distended mediastinal veins, correlating with the cardiomegaly.
