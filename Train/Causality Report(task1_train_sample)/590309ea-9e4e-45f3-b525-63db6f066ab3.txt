Causal Exploration: The absence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax indicates that the pleuritic chest pain is not caused by any acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities. The unremarkable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes, along with the lack of overt pulmonary edema and displaced fractures, further support the conclusion that no acute cardiopulmonary process is present.
