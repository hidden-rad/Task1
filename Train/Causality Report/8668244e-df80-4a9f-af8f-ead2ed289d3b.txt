Causal Exploration: The findings of mild cardiomegaly are consistent with an increased cardiothoracic ratio, indicating an enlarged heart size. The multiple bilateral lung nodules correspond to the detection of nodules in the lungs. These findings have specific locations such as the Right Lower Lobe (RLL) and Left Lower Lobe (LLL), which remain unchanged compared to the prior study.
