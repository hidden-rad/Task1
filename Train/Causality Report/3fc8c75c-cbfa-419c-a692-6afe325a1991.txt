Causal Exploration:

The examination was performed due to a positive PPD, which necessitated a detailed assessment for any signs of tuberculosis. Upon review of the PA and lateral upright chest radiographs, it was found that the heart size is top normal and the mediastinum is unremarkable. Additionally, the presence of levoscoliosis remained unchanged and the lungs were clear, showing no signs of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. These findings collectively indicate that there is no evidence of acute or chronic tuberculosis.
