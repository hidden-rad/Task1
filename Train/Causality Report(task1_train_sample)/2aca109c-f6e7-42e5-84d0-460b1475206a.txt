Causal Exploration: The presence of left pleural effusion is indicative of fluid accumulation in the pleural cavity. This condition can lead to blunting of the costophrenic angle and mediastinal shift to the right. The increased pleural effusion and low lung volumes could be contributing to the patient's respiratory compromise. The heart size appears indeterminate, possibly due to the overlying effusion and shifted mediastinum.
