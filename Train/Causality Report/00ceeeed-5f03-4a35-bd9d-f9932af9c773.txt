CAUSAL EXPLORATION:
 
 The persistent bibasilar-dominant interstitial prominence and diffusely increased interstitial markings are indicative of interstitial lung disease. The involvement of the right lung base suggests a chronic condition, such as pulmonary fibrosis. This is consistent with the findings that interstitial lung disease has been identified in the RLL (Right Lower Lobe) and LLL (Left Lower Lobe) regions.
