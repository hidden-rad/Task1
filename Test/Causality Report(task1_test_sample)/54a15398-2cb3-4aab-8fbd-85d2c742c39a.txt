Causal Exploration: The cardiomegaly (enlargement of the cardiac silhouette) is indicated by an increased cardiothoracic ratio, suggesting the heart size is beyond the normal range. The bilateral pleural effusions are confirmed by the blunting of the costophrenic angles, indicating the presence of fluid in the pleural spaces on both sides. The location information for these findings includes the Left Pleural and Right Pleural regions for pleural effusion, and the Left Ventricle, Right Ventricle, Left Atrium, and Right Atrium for cardiomegaly.
