CAUSAL EXPLORATION:
The heart size being unchanged indicates that there is no cardiomegaly. This finding is consistent with the evaluation of the heart where the cardiothoracic ratio is not over 50 and remains within the normal range. The cardiac borders are not clearly seen, suggesting that the heart position is consistent with 1/3 on the right side and 2/3 on the left side, without signs of abnormal enlargement. Additionally, the aortic knob diameter and right pulmonary artery diameter are within normal limits, further supporting the absence of cardiomegaly.

IMPRESSION: Appropriate positioning of endogastric tube.
