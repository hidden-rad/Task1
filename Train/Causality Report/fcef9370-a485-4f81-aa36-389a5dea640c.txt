CAUSAL EXPLORATION:
 
 Given the history of melanoma (A4), it is important to monitor for metastatic spread. The chest radiographs (A1) provide necessary imaging (A2) to assess for any abnormalities. The findings (A3) indicate clear lungs and normal heart size, suggesting no intrathoracic metastasis. This is consistent with the impression that there is no radiographic evidence of metastasis.
