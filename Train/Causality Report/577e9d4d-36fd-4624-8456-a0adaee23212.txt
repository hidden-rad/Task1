Causal Exploration:
 The diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, more prominent on the left, are consistent with a multifocal infectious process, likely pneumonia. The presence of a left pleural effusion with compressive basilar atelectasis correlates with findings of both pleural effusion and atelectasis. The small right pleural effusion further supports the diagnosis of pleural effusion.
