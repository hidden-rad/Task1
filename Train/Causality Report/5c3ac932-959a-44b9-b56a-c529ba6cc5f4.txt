CAUSAL EXPLORATION:
The finding of mild pulmonary edema is consistent with the detection of edema in the radiograph. The location information of the findings in the Right Lower Lobe (RLL) and Left Lower Lobe (LLL), at positions 9 and 11, provides further localization of the edema. The presence of wheezing and O2 requirement may suggest underlying respiratory distress contributing to the pulmonary edema observed.
