Causal Exploration:

The findings of well-expanded and clear lungs with no focal consolidation (A1) indicate that there is no abnormal buildup of fluids or infection in the lungs. The absence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax (A2) supports the conclusion that there is no fluid around the lungs or collapsed lung present. Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar contours (A3) suggest that the heart and surrounding structures are within normal size and shape limits. Therefore, the overall impression of no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality (A4) is consistent with the observed findings in the radiographs.
