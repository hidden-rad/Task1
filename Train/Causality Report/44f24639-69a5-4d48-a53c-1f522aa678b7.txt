CAUSAL EXPLORATION:
 
 The significant interval decrease of the lung abscess is related to the one-month treatment period. This treatment has likely led to the observed reduction in cavitary opacity. The minimal residual linear opacity may represent scarring from the previously larger abscess. The absence of new findings such as pleural effusions or pneumothorax further supports the efficacy of the treatment regimen.
