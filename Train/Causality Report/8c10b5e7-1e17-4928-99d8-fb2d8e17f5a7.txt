Causal Exploration:
The enlarged cardiac silhouette indicates cardiomegaly. The associated finding of cardiomegaly is consistent with an increased cardiothoracic ratio over 50, which is outside the normal range. The right-sided pacer with its leads in the right atrium and right ventricle, alongside the prominent mediastinal silhouette, further supports the observation of an enlarged heart. This also correlates with the absence of acute intrathoracic processes such as pleural effusion or pneumothorax, indicating a chronic condition rather than an acute one.
