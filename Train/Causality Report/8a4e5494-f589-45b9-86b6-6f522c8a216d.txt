Causal Exploration: The presence of interstitial lung disease (A4) is identified through findings such as subpleural reticular opacities which suggest interstitial fibrosis. The findings are primarily located in the right lung, specifically in the RML and RLL regions (A2), which correspond to the locations {8, 10} (A3). This supports the clinical diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (A1) and explains the observed imaging characteristics.
