Causal Exploration:
The presence of cardiomegaly suggests an enlarged heart, often associated with conditions like hypertension and heart failure. The interstitial pulmonary edema indicates fluid accumulation in the lung interstitium, commonly resulting from left-sided heart failure. Bilateral pleural effusions, or fluid in the pleural space, further support the diagnosis of heart failure exacerbation. These findings collectively suggest a progression of congestive heart failure.
