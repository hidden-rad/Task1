Causal Exploration: The absence of pleural effusions or pneumothorax indicates no acute cardiopulmonary process, which correlates with the finding that the lungs are clear. This is further validated by the fact that the previously described right lung opacity is attributed to overlying breast tissue rather than a pathological finding. Consequently, the patient's residual cough and low-grade fevers are unlikely to be due to an acute cardiopulmonary issue.
