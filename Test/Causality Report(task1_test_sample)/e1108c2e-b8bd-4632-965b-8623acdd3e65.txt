Causal Exploration: The patient, a ___ year old woman with Crohn's disease, presented with fever and diarrhea and is currently on hookworm therapy. This information prompted a chest examination to rule out infection. The radiographs showed normal heart, lungs, hila, mediastinum, and pleural surfaces, suggesting no evidence of intrathoracic malignancy or infection, including tuberculosis. Therefore, the chest findings do not indicate an infectious cause for her symptoms.
