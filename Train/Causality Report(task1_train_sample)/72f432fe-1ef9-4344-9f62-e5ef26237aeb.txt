Causal Exploration:

The small amount of fluid in the minor fissure aligns with the presence of pleural effusion in the Right Middle Lobe (RML). This pleural effusion may contribute to the low lung volumes and the elevation of the left hemidiaphragm by exerting pressure and limiting lung expansion. Consequently, this could lead to atelectasis in the affected region, further perpetuating the observed low lung volumes.
