Causal Exploration: The clear lungs and pleural spaces without evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusions, along with the absence of cavitary lesions, indicate that there are no signs of active tuberculosis. This supports the clinical indication of a history of inactive tuberculosis. The normal heart size and intact osseous structures further corroborate the lack of acute intrathoracic abnormalities.
