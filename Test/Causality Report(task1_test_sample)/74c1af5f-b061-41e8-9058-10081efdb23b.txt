CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The findings of bibasilar opacifications and opacification at the right medial lung base are suggestive of atelectasis and pneumonia. The increased density areas in the lower lung zones support the presence of these conditions. The presence of pleural plaques could be indicative of pleural effusion. These findings may contribute to the patient's oxygen desaturation.
