CAUSAL EXPLORATION:
 
 The finding of no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax (A1) was identified in the chest (A2) with views provided as PA and lateral (A3). This leads to the conclusion that there is no acute intrathoracic process (A4). The absence of critical findings supports the impression of no acute process within the thoracic cavity.
