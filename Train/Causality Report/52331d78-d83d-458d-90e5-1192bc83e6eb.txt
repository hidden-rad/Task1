Causal Exploration: The normal findings in heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours, and pulmonary vasculature, along with clear lungs and absence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax, suggest that the patient's acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath are not due to an acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. This indicates that gastroesophageal reflux disease might be a more likely cause for the symptoms.
