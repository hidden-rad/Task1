Causal Exploration:

The finding (A1) of PA and lateral chest views reveals the presence of midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips (A2), which are indicative of a previous cardiac surgery (A3). The calcified granuloma projecting over the left hemidiaphragm (A2) suggests a past granulomatous infection (A3). These findings (A1, A2, A3) correlate with the patient's history of DOE and cardiac issues (A4).
