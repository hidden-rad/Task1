Causal Exploration: 

The presence of pleural effusion and atelectasis in the left pleural space and left upper lobe can be linked to the patient's recent lobectomy and postoperative changes. The volume loss and leftward mediastinal shift indicate the ongoing impact of these conditions. The fluid accumulation at the base of the left chest suggests pleural effusion, while the increased density and volume loss are indicative of atelectasis.
