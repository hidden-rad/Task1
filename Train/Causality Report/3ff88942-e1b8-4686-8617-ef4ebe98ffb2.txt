Causal Exploration:**
The substantial cardiomegaly can be traced to the increased cardiothoracic ratio, which is over 50 and not in the normal range, indicating an abnormal heart size. The observations in the Right Atrium, Left Atrium, Right Ventricle, and Left Ventricle as well as the location {6, 12} point towards an enlarged heart. These findings correlate with the presence of cardiomegaly and suggest that the heart's size is significantly larger than normal, which is consistent with the noted substantial cardiomegaly in the report.
