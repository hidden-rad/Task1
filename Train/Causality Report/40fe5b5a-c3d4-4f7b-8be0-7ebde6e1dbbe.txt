CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The finding of fibrosis in the right lower lobe (RLL) is supported by the persistent right perihilar opacity. The associated volume loss and marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm further corroborate the presence of fibrosis in the specified location. The absence of new consolidations or pleural effusion aligns with the chronic nature of fibrosis, indicating no acute pathological changes.
