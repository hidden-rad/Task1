Causal Exploration:
The right pleural effusion is confirmed and has shown a mild decrease in extent after the placement of the pleural drain. This finding, located in the right pleural space, aligns with the observation of blunting of the costophrenic angle. The absence of pneumothorax or other complications suggests that the intervention was successful in managing the pleural effusion without causing additional issues.
