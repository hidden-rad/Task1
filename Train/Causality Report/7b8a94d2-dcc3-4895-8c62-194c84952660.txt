Causal Exploration:
Pleural effusion, which is the accumulation of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs, is not observed in the right pleural area as indicated by the absence of pleural effusions in the report. The location information {6, 11} does not indicate any abnormal findings in the corresponding regions. This suggests that the patient's postoperative condition does not involve pleural effusion in the specified area.
