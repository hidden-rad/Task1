Causal Exploration:
The heart size is enlarged, indicating cardiomegaly. Additionally, the pulmonary edema appears unchanged, suggesting that there is persistent fluid accumulation in the lungs. These findings are consistent with cardiomegaly and edema, which are commonly associated with heart failure. This condition can involve fluid buildup in the lungs and increased heart size.
