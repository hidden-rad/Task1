Causal Exploration: The finding of atelectasis at the left lung bases can be traced to the examination of the lung zones. When comparing the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area. This suggests atelectasis in the left lower lobe, which is consistent with the unchanged finding in the current report. The location information is specifically noted in the left lower lobe, with reference points at {9, 11}.
