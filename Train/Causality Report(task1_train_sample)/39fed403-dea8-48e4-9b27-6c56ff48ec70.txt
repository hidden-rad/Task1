Causal Exploration:**

The presence of atelectasis in the left lower lobe (LLL) and left upper lobe (LUL) leads to a decrease in air volume and increased opacification noted in the left hemithorax. The findings of atelectasis can be associated with the surgical history and interval changes described. The resolution of subcutaneous air in the left chest wall further supports the ongoing postoperative recovery process.
