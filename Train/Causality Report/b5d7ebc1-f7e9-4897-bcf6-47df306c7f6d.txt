Finding (A1) indicates no evidence of pneumonia, pleural effusions, or pulmonary edema, which aligns with the location information (A2) of the chest. The old left-sided rib fracture's location (A3) is also noted. The words in the list (A4) such as "infiltrate" are not present, confirming the stability of the condition.
