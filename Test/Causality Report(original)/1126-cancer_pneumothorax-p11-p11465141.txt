CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The finding of pneumothorax (A1) in the right pleural area (A2) with a dimension that remains constant (A3: {8, 10}) indicates a persistent pneumothorax. This is supported by the presence of opacities at the right lung bases and the elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, suggesting a stable condition without further complications.
