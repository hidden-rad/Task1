CAUSAL EXPLORATION:

The clear lungs and absence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and focal consolidation indicate there is no acute cardiopulmonary process. The unremarkable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes, along with the normal hilar contours, further support the conclusion that there is no radiographic evidence of sarcoidosis or other significant pathology. Consequently, this set of findings does not explain the patient's history of ___ nerve palsy, suggesting that the nerve palsy may have a non-cardiopulmonary origin.
