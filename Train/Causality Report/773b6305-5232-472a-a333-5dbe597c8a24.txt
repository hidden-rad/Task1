Causal Exploration:
 The small bilateral pleural effusion and vascular congestion in the upper lungs and both hila are indicative of underlying issues. The pleural effusion is likely contributing to the blunting of the costophrenic angle observed. Vascular congestion suggests an abnormally increased density area in the lung fields, which aligns with the findings of congestion. These findings suggest the presence of both pleural effusion and congestion, which are affecting the lower lobes and upper lungs respectively.
