**FINAL REPORT**  
**CHEST RADIOGRAPH**

**INDICATION:**  Fluid overload, evaluation for pleural effusion.

**COMPARISON:**  ___.

**FINDINGS:**  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position. Constant appearance of the heart and mediastinum after aortic stent graft. Right pectoral clips are in situ.

Unchanged evidence of mild fluid overload, bilateral pleural effusions and subsequent areas of atelectasis, left more than right.

Otherwise, the image is constant. There is no evidence of interval pneumonia or other relevant changes.

**Causal Exploration:** The presence of bilateral pleural effusions contributes to the development of atelectasis due to the compression of lung tissue, which is consistent with the findings of mild fluid overload and subsequent areas of atelectasis, particularly more prominent on the left side.
