Causal Exploration:
 
 The evaluation for pneumonia in a woman with dyspnea (A4) led to the examination of the chest (A1). The findings (A2) demonstrated that the heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours, and pulmonary vasculature are normal, with clear lungs and no pleural effusion or pneumothorax (A3). This explains the impression of no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
