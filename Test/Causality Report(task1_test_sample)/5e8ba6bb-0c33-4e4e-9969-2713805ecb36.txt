Causal Exploration:

The bilateral pleural effusions along with compressive basilar atelectasis are observed. The findings include blunting of the costophrenic angles indicating pleural effusion and an abnormally increased density area suggesting atelectasis. The lack of significant vascular congestion further supports these findings.
