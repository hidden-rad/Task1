Causal Exploration:
The moderate pulmonary edema and extensive subcutaneous emphysema observed can be attributed to post-operative changes. The mediastinal widening is likely due to fluid in the esophagus. The absence of pneumothorax and the proper placement of the ET tube suggest that the lungs are well expanded.
