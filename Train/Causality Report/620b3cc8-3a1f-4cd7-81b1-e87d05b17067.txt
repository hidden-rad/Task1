CAUSAL EXPLORATION:
 
 The patient presented with shortness of breath, cough, and fever (A4). Upon examination, the heart size was found to be normal, and the mediastinal and hilar contours were unremarkable (A1). The lungs were clear with no pleural effusion or pneumothorax present (A2), and no acute osseous abnormalities were seen (A3). Therefore, the impression is that there is no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality, which explains the symptoms (A4).
