CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The presence of a new 7-mm right apical lung nodule corresponds to the finding of a nodule in the right upper lobe (RUL). This new opacity is identified as a nodule (A4), specifically located in the right apex (A2). The prior chest radiograph did not show this nodule, suggesting it developed recently. The recommendation for follow-up CT is based on the need to further evaluate the potential malignancy of this nodule.
