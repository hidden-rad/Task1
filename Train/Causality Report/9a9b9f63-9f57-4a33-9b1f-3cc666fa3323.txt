Causal Exploration:
 The finding of pleural effusion was identified as left pleural effusion located at the left pleural space, specifically in the zones {8, 10}. This indicates an accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity, which can result in blunted costophrenic angles and obscured cardiac borders. The presence of low lung volumes further supports the diagnosis, as it is a common consequence of pleural effusion compressing the lung.
