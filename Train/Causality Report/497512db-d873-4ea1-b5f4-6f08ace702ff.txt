Causal Exploration: The patient's history of lung cancer (A4) is causing the left perihilar opacities and mediastinal shift (A1). The location of these findings is in the mediastinum and left perihilar region (A2 and A3). These findings are consistent with the patient's known cancer and radiation therapy, explaining the observed changes in the radiographs.
