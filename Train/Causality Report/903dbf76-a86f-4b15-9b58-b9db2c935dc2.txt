Causal Exploration: The hyperinflated lungs observed may indicate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This condition can cause the lungs to be abnormally expanded due to the obstruction of airflow. As a result, this can lead to the symptoms and findings noted in the report, such as the absence of effusion or pneumothorax and the clear appearance of the lungs despite the clinical history of left-sided chest pain.
