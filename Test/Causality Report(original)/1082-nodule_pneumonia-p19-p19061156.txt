Causal Exploration:
 The lateral view revealing a 13mm lobulated retrosternal lung nodule necessitates further investigation. The presence of this nodule might be causally related to the history of cough and potential pneumonia, which warrants a CT scan for a definitive distinction and diagnosis. The critical imaging findings emphasize the need for direct communication with the referring physician to ensure timely and appropriate follow-up.
