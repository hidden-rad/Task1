CAUSAL EXPLORATION:
 The presence of atelectasis is confirmed, which can cause increased density in specific lung areas. The locations of the findings are in the Right Lower Lobe (RLL) and Left Lower Lobe (LLL), as well as specific nodal points {9, 11}. The atelectasis may contribute to the observed consolidation and scarring, which are further complicated by suspected acute infection.
