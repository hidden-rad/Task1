Causal Exploration:

The nodular opacities found in the bilateral lung fields, especially in the left lower lung, correspond to the nodule (A4) identified in the left lower lobe (A2) at locations {8, 11} (A3). This finding in the left lower lung is consistent with the previously described pulmonary nodules, indicating metastases (A1).
