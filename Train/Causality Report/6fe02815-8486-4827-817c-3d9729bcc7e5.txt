Causal Exploration: The examination of the chest (PA and LAT) provided the necessary views, and the findings indicate that the lungs are fully expanded and clear with no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal, and the heart size is normal. These findings imply that there is no evidence of active or latent pulmonary tuberculosis, correlating with the patient's history of a positive PPD but no history of tuberculosis (hx of pos PPD, no known TB hx). This causal relationship confirms that, despite the hx of positive PPD and likely hx of BCG, there is no current pulmonary disease present.
