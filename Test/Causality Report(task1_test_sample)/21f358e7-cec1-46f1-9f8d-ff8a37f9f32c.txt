Causal Exploration:
The finding of mild cardiomegaly is noted in the chest radiograph. This cardiomegaly involves the Right Atrium, Left Atrium, Right Ventricle, and Left Ventricle. The assessment of the cardiac size indicates that the cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range, confirming the presence of cardiomegaly. Additionally, the positions and sizes of the aortic arch and pulmonary trunk are within normal limits, as the Aortic knob diameter does not exceed 35 cm and the Right and Left pulmonary artery diameters are not more than 20 mm, respectively.
