CAUSAL EXPLORATION:

The right-sided PICC line is unchanged, which suggests that the placement of the new stent within the distal aspect of the left mainstem bronchus did not affect the positioning of the PICC line. The displacement of the distal trachea and carina toward the right is causally linked to a large esophageal mass, which was better evaluated on a prior CT. This mass is likely the reason for the need to place a new stent in the left mainstem bronchus. The lungs are clear, and there are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax, indicating that the stent placement did not result in immediate pulmonary complications.
