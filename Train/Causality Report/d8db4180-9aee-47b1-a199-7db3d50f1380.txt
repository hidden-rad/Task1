Causal Exploration: 

The chest X-ray was performed as a pre-operative measure for a patient with a perirectal abscess. The findings indicate that there are no acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities. This normal chest X-ray ensures that the patient does not have any underlying cardiopulmonary conditions that could complicate the surgical procedure for the perirectal abscess. Thus, the clear lungs and normal heart size support the decision to proceed with surgery.
