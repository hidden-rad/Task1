Causal Exploration: The evaluation was conducted due to a history of hypertension (A4) to assess for mediastinal widening (A1). Upon examination (A2), the heart was found to be normal in size without any evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia (A3). Consequently, no mediastinal widening or evidence of aortic abnormality was observed.
