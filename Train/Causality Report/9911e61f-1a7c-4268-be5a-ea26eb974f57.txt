Causal Exploration:
The reason for the exam (status post right VATS with mediastinal lymphadenopathy) is linked to the findings of the chest PA and lateral views. The normal cardiac size and the less conspicuous mediastinal lymphadenopathy suggest a positive response to the treatment. The stability of right hilar lymphadenopathy indicates no further progression of the disease. The clear lungs and absence of pneumothorax show no new complications. The small bilateral pleural effusions could be a residual effect post-surgery.
