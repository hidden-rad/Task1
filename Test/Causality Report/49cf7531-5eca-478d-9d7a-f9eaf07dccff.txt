CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The finding of fibrosis, specifically in the right lower lobe (RLL) and left lower lobe (LLL), correlates with the increased interstitial markings and bibasilar fibrosis observed in the current and prior radiographs. The locations {6, 7} further substantiate the involvement of these specific lobes.
