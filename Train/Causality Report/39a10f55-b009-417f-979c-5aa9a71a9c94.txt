CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The moderate cardiomegaly observed can be linked to an increased cardiothoracic ratio over 50%, indicating an enlarged heart. The presence of moderate pulmonary edema is associated with an abnormally increased density area in the lung zones, suggesting fluid accumulation within the lung tissue.
