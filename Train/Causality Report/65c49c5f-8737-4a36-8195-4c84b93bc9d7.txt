Causal Exploration:
The patient's condition of persistent sputum and multiple allergies to all oral antibiotics makes it impossible to treat as an outpatient, complicating her clinical management. The chronic widespread mild to moderate bronchiectasis and peribronchial inflammation noted on prior CT scans are likely the underlying cause of the persistent sputum. The increased bronchial wall thickening observed today, compared to previous chest radiographs and the same day as the chest CT, suggests a worsening of suppurative bronchiectasis. This worsening, rather than pneumonia, is causing the patient's current signs and symptoms.
