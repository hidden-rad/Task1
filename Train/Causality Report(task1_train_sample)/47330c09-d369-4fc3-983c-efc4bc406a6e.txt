Causal Exploration: The findings of cardiomegaly and pleural effusion indicate an enlarged heart size and the presence of fluid in the pleural spaces. The right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle are likely involved, with pleural effusions noted in both the right and left pleural spaces. This correlates with the observed bilateral pleural effusions and the heart size being enlarged but stable.
