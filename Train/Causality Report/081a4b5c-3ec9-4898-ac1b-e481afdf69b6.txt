Causal Exploration:

The hyperinflation of the lungs and the presence of bronchiectasis in the right upper lung field are likely the cause of the patient's episodes of isolated left-sided chest pain. Additionally, the mild degenerative changes noted within the thoracic spine may contribute to the reported discomfort. Recent URI could have exacerbated these underlying conditions, resulting in the observed symptoms.
