Causal Exploration:

The examination of the chest via frontal and lateral views (A2) was conducted due to a history of flank pain and fever (A3). The findings (A1) revealed no definite focal consolidation and no pleural effusion or pneumothorax, explaining the absence of an acute cardiopulmonary process (A4). The previously noted pulmonary nodules were better visualized on prior CT scans, reinforcing the unremarkable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes.
