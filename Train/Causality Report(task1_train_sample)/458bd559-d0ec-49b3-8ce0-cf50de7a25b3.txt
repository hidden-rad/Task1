Causal Exploration: The increased opacification at the right base is likely due to pleural effusion as evidenced by the blunting of the costophrenic angle and the absence of fractures or abnormal lesions. Additionally, the presence of pneumonia in the right lower lobe (RLL) may be contributing to the observed opacification and underlying atelectasis. The specific locations of these findings—Right Lower Lobe for pneumonia and Right Pleural for pleural effusion—align with the clinical presentation and radiographic observations.
