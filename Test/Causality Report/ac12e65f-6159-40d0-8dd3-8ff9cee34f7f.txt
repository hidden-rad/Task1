Causal Exploration:
The detection of cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema is supported by various imaging observations. Cardiomegaly is indicated by the cardiothoracic ratio being over 50, which is not in the normal range. The mild prominence of pulmonary interstitial markings suggests mild pulmonary edema, which correlates with an abnormally increased density area in the lung zones. These findings are consistent with the observed unchanged cardiomegaly and the mild pulmonary edema noted in the report.
