Causal Exploration: The patient's anterior chest trauma one week ago has likely resulted in the left pleuritic rib pain and the observed blunting of the left costophrenic recess. This trauma may have caused inflammation or contusion in the left lower lobe, explaining the radiographic findings. Given the absence of pneumothorax or rib fractures, the clinical symptoms are likely due to parenchymal injury or infection secondary to the initial trauma.
