Causal Exploration:
The finding of mild cardiomegaly suggests an increased cardiothoracic ratio, indicating an abnormal enlargement of the heart. This condition can lead to secondary issues such as pleural effusions, which are noted to be larger on the right side. The unchanged mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema may also be a consequence of the cardiomegaly, as the heart's impaired ability to pump efficiently can result in fluid accumulation in the lungs.
