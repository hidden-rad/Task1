Finding metastasis in the locations RUL, RML, RLL, LUL, and LLL with the given coordinates {2, 12} indicates the presence of multiple pulmonary nodules and interstitial thickening. This suggests extensive metastatic disease leading to the observed findings in the left pleural effusion and lymphangitic spread.
