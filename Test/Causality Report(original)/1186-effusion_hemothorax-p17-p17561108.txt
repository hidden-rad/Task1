Causal Exploration: The finding of large right loculated pleural effusion, located at the right pleural, with a dominant 7.5 cm loculated component laterally in the right mid-to-lower hemithorax, aligns with the observed volume loss in the right hemithorax. This effusion contributes to the persistent mediastinal widening on the right, while the left lung remains clear with no evidence of left pleural effusion.
