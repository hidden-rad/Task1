CAUSAL EXPLORATION:
 The right chest tube placement has led to the drainage of the extensive right pleural effusion. Despite this intervention, a low lung volume and some degree of right pleural effusion persist. The improvement in right lung aeration confirms the effectiveness of the chest tube, while the stability of the left lung and heart suggests no further complications.
