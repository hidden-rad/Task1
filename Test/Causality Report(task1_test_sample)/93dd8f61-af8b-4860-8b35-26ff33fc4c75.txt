Causal Exploration:
The absence of concerning skeletal findings (A4) on the chest X-ray indicates that there are no abnormalities or pathologies detected in the skeletal system. This finding supports the conclusion that there is no radiographic evidence of active or latent pulmonary tuberculosis infection (A1). The location information of the findings (A2 and A3) pertains to the heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours, and the lungs and pleural surfaces, all of which appear normal. This normal appearance across multiple anatomical locations further corroborates the impression that there is no latent tuberculosis infection.
