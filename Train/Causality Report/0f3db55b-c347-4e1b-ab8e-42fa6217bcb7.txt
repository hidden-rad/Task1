Causal Exploration: The finding of interstitial lung disease, specifically interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, in both the right and left lungs indicates a symmetrical progression of the disease. This symmetrical pattern suggests the possibility of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or hemorrhage as underlying causes. The presence of small bilateral pleural effusions further supports the likelihood of pulmonary edema. The lack of change in heart size also points towards edema rather than cardiac-related issues.
