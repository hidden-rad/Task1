Causal Exploration: The finding of cardiomegaly (enlarged cardiac size) involves the right atrium, left atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle. This is supported by the fact that the cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not within the normal range, indicating an enlarged heart size. The location of the finding is further corroborated by the observation that the heart position is not located on 1/3 the right side and 2/3 on the left side. The enlargement is mild, which aligns with the lack of gross failure present.
