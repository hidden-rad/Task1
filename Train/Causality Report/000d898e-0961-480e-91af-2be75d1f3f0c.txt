Causal Exploration: 

The examination (A1) conducted was a chest PA and lateral view (A2), which aimed to investigate possible active pulmonary tuberculosis (A3). The findings indicate that the lungs are fully expanded and clear, with no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. This lack of abnormal findings supports the impression of no evidence of active pulmonary tuberculosis.
