Causal Exploration:

The improvement in pulmonary edema (A4) is noted predominantly in the RLL and LLL (A2). This change can be identified through the absence of abnormal density areas in the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones (A3). The consistent branching of lung vessels and the absence of blunted costophrenic angles further support this observation.
