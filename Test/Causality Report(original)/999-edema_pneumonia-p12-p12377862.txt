Causal Exploration:

The mild pulmonary edema observed is likely due to the underlying condition of COPD causing the hyperexpansion of the lungs. This condition may contribute to fluid accumulation in the lung tissues, particularly in the RLL and LLL regions. The absence of pleural effusions and new consolidation supports that the edema is mild and localized. The top-normal heart size and normal mediastinal contours further indicate that the cardiovascular system is functioning within normal parameters, thus not significantly contributing to the edema.
