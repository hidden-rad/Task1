Causal Exploration:

The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB), chills, and heart racing prompted the chest radiographs. These findings indicate that the lungs are clear and well-expanded, suggesting no respiratory cause for the SOB and chills. The mildly enlarged heart observed may be a chronic condition, but it is not causing an acute cardiopulmonary issue. Therefore, the symptoms are not linked to any acute findings on the radiographs. The lack of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation further supports the absence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.
