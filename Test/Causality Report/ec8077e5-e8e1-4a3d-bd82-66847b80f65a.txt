Causal Exploration:
The mechanical fall two weeks ago may have caused the splenic injury, which is the primary concern for evaluation. The head trauma from yesterday could potentially exacerbate any underlying conditions from the initial fall. The normal findings in the chest radiograph, including the clear lungs and absence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax, suggest that there are no acute thoracic injuries complicating the patient's current condition.
