Causal Exploration:
The finding of clear lungs without focal consolidation, effusion, or edema (A1) is supported by the absence of pneumonia symptoms (A4). The location information (A2) and the comparative analysis (A3) confirm that there are no changes from prior imaging, reinforcing the conclusion of no acute cardiopulmonary process.
