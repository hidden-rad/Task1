CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The patient presented with a cough and congestion for two weeks. The chest X-ray findings show that the lungs are clear without focal consolidation, and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Additionally, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Therefore, the absence of acute cardiopulmonary pathology on the imaging correlates with the clinical symptoms but does not indicate a severe underlying condition.
