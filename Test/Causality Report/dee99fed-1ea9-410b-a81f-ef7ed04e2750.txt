Causal Exploration: The finding of a mildly prominent left atrial appendage (A1) is located in the heart region (A2) and appears on the chest radiograph (A3). This could be related to the recurrent right vertebral artery dissection (A4) noted in the patient's history, potentially contributing to or resulting from altered hemodynamics.
