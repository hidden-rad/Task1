Causal Exploration:
The findings of large pleural effusion and pneumothorax are indicative of fluid accumulation in the pleural space and air in the pleural cavity, respectively. This results in compromised lung expansion and entrapment, which may lead to the observed partially collapsed lung. The presence of pneumothorax can cause one lung to appear prominently larger than the other and result in asymmetry in the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones. The blunting of the costophrenic angle further supports the presence of pleural effusion.
