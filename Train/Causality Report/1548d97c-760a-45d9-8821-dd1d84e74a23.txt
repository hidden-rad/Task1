Causal Exploration: The lungs are clear, indicating no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The heart size is normal, with stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes, suggesting no acute changes post-CABG. The pacemaker leads are correctly placed in the right atrium and right ventricle, further supporting the absence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
