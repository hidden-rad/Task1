Causal Exploration:

Finding the pleural effusion shows the presence of fluid accumulation in the pleural space (pleural effusion). The location information indicates that the left pleural effusion is located at the left pleural and is more severe between the regions 8 and 10. This is consistent with the report indicating that the left side is worse than the right.
