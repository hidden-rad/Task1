CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The positive PPD test (A4) led to the evaluation for active tuberculosis (A1). The chest X-ray (A2) provided the imaging results, which were located in the findings section (A3). These findings indicated no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax and normal cardiomediastinal and hilar contours, leading to the impression of no acute cardiopulmonary process.
