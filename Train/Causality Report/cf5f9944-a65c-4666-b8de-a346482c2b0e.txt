CAUSAL EXPLORATION:

The finding of normal cardiomediastinal and hilar contours (A1) indicates that there are no abnormalities in the chest structure (A2). The clear lungs without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax (A3) further support the absence of any acute disease process (A4). As a result, the impression confirms no acute cardiopulmonary process, correlating all the normal findings to indicate a stable condition.
