Causal Exploration:
The symptom of fever and cough for 1 week (A4) led to the investigation of the patientâ€™s health status (A1). The chest radiographs were taken to locate any potential issues (A2) and the non-finding of any acute cardiopulmonary process (A3) was reported. This sequence of events shows that the initial symptoms prompted a thorough examination, which ultimately found no serious issues with the patient's cardiopulmonary system.
