Causal Exploration:
The findings of moderately severe pulmonary edema and moderate bilateral pleural effusion are consistent with the observations of abnormal increased density areas and blunting of the costophrenic angles, respectively. The assessment of the lung zones being asymmetrical also supports the presence of edema. Given the normal cardiothoracic ratio and non-distended mediastinal veins, the cause is likely increased capillary permeability rather than cardiac issues. The location information includes the right pleural and left pleural regions.
