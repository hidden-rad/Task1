Causal Exploration:
The patient's syncopal episode prompted the chest radiograph (A1). The findings (A2) of the PA and lateral views indicated no acute intrathoracic process, as evidenced by the clear lungs and normal heart size (A3). The presence of a left chest wall pacer with lead tips extending into the right atrium and ventricle further supports the absence of an acute condition requiring immediate intervention.
