Causal Exploration: The trace right pleural effusion is located at the right pleural space, specifically in the right lower lobe (RLL), and is associated with bibasilar patchy opacities which could be due to atelectasis in the same region. The minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle further supports the presence of a small effusion.
