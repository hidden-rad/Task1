CAUSAL EXPLORATION:
The trace left pleural effusion observed in the radiographs is likely a residual effect following the patient's history of splenic infarct. This causal relationship highlights that the ongoing medical issues, including the splenic infarct and past pleural effusion, are contributing factors to the current trace effusion observed. The absence of focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pneumothoraces further supports that the pleural effusion is isolated and not a result of an acute pulmonary process.
