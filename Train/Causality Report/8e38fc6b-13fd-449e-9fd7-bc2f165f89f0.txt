Causal Exploration:
 
 The patient presented with a cough and back pain, prompting an evaluation for pneumonia (A1). The PA and lateral chest films were taken at 9:44 (A2), and the findings were compared to the patient's prior study (A3). The examination revealed that the cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits, and the lungs are well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia (A4).
