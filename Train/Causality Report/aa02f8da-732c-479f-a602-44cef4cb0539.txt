Causal Exploration:
The patient's history of untreated tuberculosis led to the decision to perform a portable chest examination to assess for active TB. The findings indicate clear lungs and no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or abnormalities in cardiac mediastinal silhouettes. Consequently, the impression is that there are no radiographic signs of active tuberculosis or acute cardiopulmonary process.
