Causal Exploration:
 The finding of clear lungs and normal cardiac and mediastinal contours, along with no pleural abnormality seen in the radiographs, confirms the absence of active or latent tuberculosis infection. This is consistent with the history of a positive PPD test, where the primary goal was to rule out TB. The clear lungs and normal contours effectively rule out TB, as there are no radiographic signs of infection.
