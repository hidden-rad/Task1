Causal Exploration: The overinflated lungs with biapical hyperlucency, widening of the anteroposterior diameter, and increased retrosternal clear space, along with the absence of pleural effusions, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum, are indicative of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The findings of emphysema contribute to the overinflated lung appearance. Additionally, the demineralized bones and thoracic hyperkyphosis with multilevel bridging ossification could be related to the patient's overall health status and possibly prolonged corticosteroid use in managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The subacute proximal right humeral fracture is likely a result of the recent fall, compounded by the bone demineralization.
