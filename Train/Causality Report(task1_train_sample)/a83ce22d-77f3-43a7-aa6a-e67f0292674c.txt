Causal Exploration:

The presence of multiple lung nodules, as noted in the findings, is consistent with metastasis. This aligns with the finding of metastasis located in multiple areas, such as the RUL and RML, which display abnormally increased density areas upon comparison of the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones of the lungs. The metastasis likely originated from primary cancer and has spread to the lungs, manifesting as these nodules.
