Causal Exploration:**
The presence of bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis can be attributed to underlying right-sided CHF and the history of Hodgkin's lymphoma with prior radiation therapy. The blunting of costophrenic angles and asymmetry in lung zones are consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis. Such findings often result from fluid accumulation and subsequent lung collapse, exacerbating symptoms of shortness of breath and hypoxia.
