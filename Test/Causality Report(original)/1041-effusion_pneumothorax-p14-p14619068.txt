Causal Exploration:

The old deformity of the left mid shaft clavicle noted in the findings is relevant to the historical syncope and collapse. Low lung volumes limiting the assessment may contribute to the absence of significant findings such as focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The normal cardiomediastinal silhouette and intact osseous structures further support the conclusion of no acute intrathoracic process.
