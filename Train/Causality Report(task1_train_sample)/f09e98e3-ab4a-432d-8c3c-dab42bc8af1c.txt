Causal Exploration:
 The finding of blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely represents pleural and parenchymal scarring, which has been consistent in multiple prior studies. This explains the absence of acute cardiopulmonary processes, such as focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. The unchanged location of the left pectoral dual-chamber pacemaker and its leads further supports the stability of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Therefore, the patient's current symptoms are unlikely due to an acute cardiopulmonary issue. 

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
