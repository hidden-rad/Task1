Causal Exploration:
Finding pleural effusion involves identifying fluid accumulation in the pleural space. The location information for this finding is noted as Left Pleural and the degree of pleural effusion is essentially unchanged, suggesting a consistent presence in the left pleural area. The costophrenic angle's blunting supports the identification of pleural effusion.
