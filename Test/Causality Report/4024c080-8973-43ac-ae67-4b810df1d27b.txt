Causal Exploration: The observed cardiomegaly or enlarged heart size can be associated with the prominent pulmonary artery and the history of COPD. Cardiomegaly, as indicated by a cardiothoracic ratio over 50, could be affecting the Right Atrium, Left Atrium, Right Ventricle, and Left Ventricle. This enlargement may contribute to the presence of pulmonary hypertension and other related abnormalities.
