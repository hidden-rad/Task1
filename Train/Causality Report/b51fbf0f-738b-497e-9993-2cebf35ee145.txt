Causal Exploration: The right pleural effusion is causing the absence of pulmonary markings in the right lung apex. This indicates the presence of air in the pleural space, likely due to the effusion. This also explains the need for clinical correlation to assess the worsening condition of the right pleural effusion/hydrothorax. The large effusion suggests that the effusion has increased over time, necessitating further evaluation and potential intervention.
