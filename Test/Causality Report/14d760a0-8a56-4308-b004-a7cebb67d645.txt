CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The massive elevation of the right hemidiaphragm (A3) reduces lung volume (A2), which contributes to the patient's breathing difficulties. However, no evidence of pneumonia or other infectious processes (A4) suggests that while the diaphragm's elevation impacts lung function, it does not necessarily indicate an infectious source. The tortuosity of the aorta and the interposed bowel loops may further complicate the clinical picture, but they are not directly related to an infection (A1).
