CAUSAL EXPLORATION:
 
 The findings indicate that the heart size is normal and the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable (A1). The clear lungs and pleural surfaces without effusion or pneumothorax suggest no acute issues (A2). The absence of a displaced rib fracture aligns with the patient's history of recent pulmonary embolus presenting with right-sided rib pain (A3). Hence, the overall impression is that there is no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality (A4).
