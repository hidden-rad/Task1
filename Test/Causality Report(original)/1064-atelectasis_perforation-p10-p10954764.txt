Causal Exploration: The detection of pleural effusion (A1) corresponds to the findings of mild bilateral pleural effusions (A4) in the right and left pleural spaces (A2). The location information is specified as right pleural and left pleural with coordinates {9, 10} (A3). This indicates a mild fluid accumulation in both pleural spaces.
