The large amount of free intra-abdominal air observed can be attributed to recent surgery, as there is no clinical evidence of visceral perforation. The extremely low lung volumes are causing crowding of the bronchovascular structures, which aligns with the findings that there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
