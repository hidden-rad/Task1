Causal Exploration: The finding of pleural effusion in the left pleural area, specifically located at the vertebral levels T11 and T12, is noted. This pleural effusion could be contributing to the respiratory distress observed in the patient. The blunting of the costophrenic angle on the lateral margins of the lung further supports the presence of pleural effusion.
