Causal Exploration:
The patient's history of cough and chest pain led to the examination (A1). The chest PA and lateral technique (A2) were used to locate the findings. Based on the examination, the aorta is calcified, indicating atherosclerosis (A4), which could contribute to the observed symptoms. The findings were documented in the final report (A3).
