CAUSAL EXPLORATION:
 The right lower lung opacities identified in the radiograph are consistent with pneumonia located in the right lower lobe, as detailed in the list. The presence of these opacities, along with the clinical context of aspiration, suggests that the findings of pneumonia in the right lower lobe are contributing to the noted opacities in this region.

 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. ET tube ends above the clavicles and could be advanced by approximately 3
 cm for more secure positioning.
 
 2. Enteric tube with the tip in the stomach but the side hole above the level
 of the GE junction.
 
 3. Left subclavian central venous catheter in appropriate position.
 
 4. Right lower lung and retrocardiac opacities most likely represent
 aspiration.
