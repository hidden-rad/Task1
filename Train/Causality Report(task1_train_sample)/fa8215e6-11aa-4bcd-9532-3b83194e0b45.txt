CAUSAL EXPLORATION:

The patient presented with dyspnea and cough, warranting an evaluation for pneumonia. The chest PA and lateral radiographs were performed to identify any potential causes for these symptoms. The findings indicated that the lungs are clear, with no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation present, effectively ruling out pneumonia as a cause for the symptoms. Additionally, no acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities were found, confirming that the heart size and pulmonary vasculature are within normal limits. Thus, the symptoms of dyspnea and cough are not attributable to an acute cardiopulmonary condition or pneumonia according to the imaging results.
