Causal Exploration: The normal chest radiograph indicates no signs of parenchymal abnormality, lymphadenopathy, or pleural effusions. This suggests that the rheumatoid arthritis and the 4-week cough have not caused any visible infiltration or pleural effusion in the lungs. Consequently, the findings align with the clinical suspicion of no significant changes in the patient's chest condition.
