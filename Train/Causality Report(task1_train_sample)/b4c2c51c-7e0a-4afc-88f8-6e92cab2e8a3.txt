Causal Exploration:

The presence of pleural effusion and mass in the left upper lobe as noted in the findings is consistent with the patient's known history of metastasis. The location of the pleural effusion in the left pleural space and the mass in the left upper lobe are confirmed by the radiographic evidence. The lack of significant change in the severity of the left pleural fluid indicates stability in the condition.
