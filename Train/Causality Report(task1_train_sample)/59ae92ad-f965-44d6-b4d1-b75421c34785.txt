CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The well-inflated and clear lungs suggest that there is no atelectasis. The absence of focal consolidation, nodule, effusion, or pneumothorax supports this further. Normal cardiac and mediastinal contours indicate no deviation or abnormality that could be associated with atelectasis. The lack of free peritoneal air aligns with findings of no subcutaneous emphysema or hiatus hernia.
