Causal Exploration: The presence of a small right pleural effusion suggests fluid accumulation in the pleural space. This is typically due to an imbalance between fluid production and absorption, often secondary to conditions like heart failure, infection, or malignancy. The giant bullae and severe emphysema complicate the radiographic interpretation by mimicking pleural edges. Thus, a chest CT may be necessary to exclude any residual pneumothorax and to rule out underlying malignancies, as spontaneous pneumothorax is rare in severe emphysema patients without predisposing conditions.
