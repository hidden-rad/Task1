Causal Exploration: The decreased left lung volume is due to atelectasis in the left lower lobe. The presence of a small to moderate pneumothorax in the left lung is identified, which correlates with the increased density area observed in the imaging. The well-defined dense consolidation in the left lung mass is likely a post-treatment change from the RFA procedure. The cardiac and mediastinal contours remain unchanged, indicating no significant shift or deviation.

Findings were discussed with the patient's PACU nurse at 2:15 p.m. at the time of discovery.
