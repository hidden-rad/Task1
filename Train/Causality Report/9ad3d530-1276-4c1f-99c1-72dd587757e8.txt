Causal Exploration:

The finding of pneumomediastinum, indicated by the pleural line seen below the inferior border of the posterior second rib, suggests the presence of air in the mediastinal space. This could be caused by the recent procedure involving the placement of a double-lumen tube, which may have introduced air into the pleural space, leading to a small right apical pneumothorax. The normal appearance of the heart size, mediastinal, and hilar contours supports the absence of significant mediastinal shift or large volume pneumothorax.
