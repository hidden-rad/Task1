Causal Exploration: The presence of cardiomegaly suggests an enlargement of the heart, which is often associated with congestive heart failure. The diffuse bilateral reticulonodular interstitial pattern and blunting of the right costophrenic angle further support the diagnosis, as these findings are consistent with interstitial edema and pleural effusion, respectively, which are common in congestive heart failure. The involvement of the right lung base more prominently indicates a possible location-specific manifestation of fluid accumulation.
