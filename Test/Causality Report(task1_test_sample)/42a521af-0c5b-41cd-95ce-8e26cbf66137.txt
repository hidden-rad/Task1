Causal Exploration:

The patient's history of alcohol abuse (A4) may contribute to multiple health issues including abdominal pain and desaturation (A2). However, the chest X-ray findings (A1) show no acute cardiopulmonary process and no free intraperitoneal air, indicating that the cause of the symptoms (A3) is not related to any acute chest pathology.
