Causal Exploration:

The examination indicates that the previous mild pulmonary edema has resolved, leading to fully expanded and clear lungs. This finding suggests that the initial GI bleed did not lead to infectious complications such as pneumonia. The normal heart size and absence of pleural abnormalities further support the conclusion that there are no significant cardiopulmonary issues contributing to the patient's condition. Thus, the chest radiographs confirm that the patient's lungs are in good condition, and no infectious triggers are present to cause decompensation.
