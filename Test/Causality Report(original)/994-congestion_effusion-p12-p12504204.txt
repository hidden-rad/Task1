Causal Exploration:

The findings indicate a normal-sized heart and clear lungs, suggesting no current pulmonary issues. Given the patient's history of positive PPD and treatment for TB, the absence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or old granulomatous disease implies effective past treatment and no lingering complications. Thus, the patient is cleared of any current TB-related abnormalities, supporting her suitability for school entry screening.
