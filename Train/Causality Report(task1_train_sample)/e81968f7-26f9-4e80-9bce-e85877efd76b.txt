CAUSAL EXPLORATION:

The finding of lymphadenopathy, specifically located in the Right Hilum and Left Hilum, indicates the presence of abnormal enlargement of lymph nodes. This could explain the bilateral hilar fullness observed on the chest radiographs. Given the absence of pleural effusion, focal consolidation, or pneumothorax, the cause of bilateral hilar fullness is more likely related to lymphadenopathy rather than vascular anomalies alone.
