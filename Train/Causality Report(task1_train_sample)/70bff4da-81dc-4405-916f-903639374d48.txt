Causal Exploration:

The finding of cardiomegaly indicates an enlargement of the heart, which can be specifically assessed by the cardiothoracic ratio being over 50 and not in the normal range. The presence of an enlarged cardiac silhouette suggests this abnormality. Additionally, the observation of the heart's position, where it is not located on 1/3 the right side and 2/3 on the left side, further supports the diagnosis of cardiomegaly. The location information relevant to the heart's enlargement involves the Right Atrium, Left Atrium, Right Ventricle, and Left Ventricle, which are important for understanding the anatomical changes observed.
