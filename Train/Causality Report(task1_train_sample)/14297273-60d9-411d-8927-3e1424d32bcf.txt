Causal Exploration:

Finding pleural effusion (pleural effusion) in the right pleural location with the pleural catheter and the information {8, 11} indicating "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting" and "When trace the hemidiaphragms into the vertebra, right diaphragm is not higher than left" suggests that the effusion is causing changes in the lung's appearance and diaphragm positioning.
