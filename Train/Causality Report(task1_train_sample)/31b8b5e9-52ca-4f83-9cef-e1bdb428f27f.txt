Causal Exploration:

The presence of diffuse opacity in bilateral lungs suggests pulmonary edema, which is consistent with the worsening condition. The small to moderate right pleural effusion and stable left pleural effusion indicate ongoing pleural involvement. The cardiomediastinal silhouette enlargement supports the diagnosis of increased fluid accumulation, further confirming the presence of both pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.
