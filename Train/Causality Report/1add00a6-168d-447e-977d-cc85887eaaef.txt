Causal Exploration: The findings of pneumonia and small pleural effusion in the left lower lobe and left pleural areas are consistent with the symptoms of ongoing high fevers in the patient. The presence of pneumonia is indicated by the abnormal increase in density in the lung zones, while pleural effusion is suggested by the blunting of the costophrenic angle.
