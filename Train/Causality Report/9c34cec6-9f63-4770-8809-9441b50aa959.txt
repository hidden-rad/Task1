Causal Exploration: The presence of cardiomegaly, as indicated by an increased cardiothoracic ratio, is associated with diffuse pulmonary edema. This condition likely contributes to the noted bilateral pleural effusions. Additionally, the limited visibility of the retrocardiac space suggests the possibility of superimposed pneumonia, which cannot be fully excluded in this patient.
