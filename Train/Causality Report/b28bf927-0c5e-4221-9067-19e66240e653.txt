Causal Exploration:
The finding of pleural effusion (A1) indicates an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. The location of the effusion is specified as the Left Pleural (A2), with the extent of the effusion being identified within the range of {3, 11} (A3). This left basal opacity is consistent with pleural effusion (A4), as observed on the chest X-ray.
