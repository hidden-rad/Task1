Causal Exploration: The top normal cardiac size and low lung volumes observed may be influenced by the patient's liver disease and ascites. Ascites can lead to elevated diaphragm positioning and subsequently reduced lung volumes. The absence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion further corroborates the lack of acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities, aligning with the patient's clinical presentation.
