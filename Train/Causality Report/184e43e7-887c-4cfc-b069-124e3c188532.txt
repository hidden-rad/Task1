Causal Exploration: The patient's clear lungs without confluent consolidation (A1) and stable pulmonary vasculature (A2) indicate no significant progression of disease. The absence of acute interstitial edema (A3) and no large pleural effusion (A4) further support the conclusion of no acute cardiopulmonary process.
