CAUSAL EXPLORATION:

Finding effusion indicates the presence of fluid accumulation in the pleural spaces. This can be located in the Left Pleural, Right Pleural, and ribs 8 and 9 areas. The small or non-existent pleural effusions noted here suggest that any effusion present is minimal and does not significantly impact lung function or heart size.
