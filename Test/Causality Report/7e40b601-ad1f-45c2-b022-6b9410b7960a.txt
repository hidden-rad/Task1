CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The finding of the nasogastric tube positioning at the level of the GE junction and the recommendation to advance it 5-7 cm for optimal positioning is based on the portable AP upright chest radiograph. This radiograph is the source that provides the location information of the finding, showing that the tube is currently at the GE junction and suggesting further advancement to ensure proper placement.
