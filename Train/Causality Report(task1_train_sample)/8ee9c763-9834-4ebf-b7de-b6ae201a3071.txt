Causal Exploration:

The moderate left pleural effusion has increased in size, likely due to the persistent fluid accumulation in the left pleural space. The small right pleural effusion remains unchanged, indicating a stable but unresolved effusion. The presence of mild cardiomegaly suggests that the heart size has been slightly enlarged, which can be associated with fluid overload conditions contributing to pleural effusion. The stability of the cardiomegaly indicates no acute change in heart size.
