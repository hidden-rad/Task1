Causal Exploration:

The finding of a small left pleural effusion is significant. When tracing the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, a blunting of the costophrenic angle was noted, consistent with the presence of pleural effusion. Given the location information of the finding in the left pleural area and the specific coordinates {3, 11}, it aligns with the observed left pleural effusion in the radiograph.
