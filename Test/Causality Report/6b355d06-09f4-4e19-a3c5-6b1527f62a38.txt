Causal Exploration: The history of dizziness (A4) prompted the evaluation for infiltrate, as dizziness can sometimes be associated with respiratory issues. The chest radiograph (A1) was performed to search for any such abnormalities. The findings (A2) indicate low lung volumes but no acute respiratory conditions. The comparison (A3) with the previous radiograph revealed new fusion hardware in the cervical spine, which is not related to the dizziness but is noted as a significant change.
