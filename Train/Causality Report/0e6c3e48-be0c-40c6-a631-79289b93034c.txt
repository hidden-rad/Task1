Causal Exploration: The patient, a ___ year old woman with diabetes, tested positive for PPD and required a chest X-ray (CXR) for TB screening. The CXR findings indicate that the heart size is normal, and no evidence of active or chronic tuberculosis is present. The tortuous aorta involving the descending portion is observed, and the lungs are essentially clear, further supporting the absence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
