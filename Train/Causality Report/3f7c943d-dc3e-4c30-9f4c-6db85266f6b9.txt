Causal Exploration: Examination of the trachea and bronchi showed no deviation or abnormal widening, ensuring that the airways were not obstructed. Both lungs were assessed for symmetry and volume, revealing that one lung was not prominently larger than the other. Further assessment showed an abnormally increased density in the lower zones, indicating atelectasis in the RLL and LLL regions. The cardiac and diaphragmatic positions were normal, ruling out other causes for the observed atelectasis, which was noted to be worse on the right.
