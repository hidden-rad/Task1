Causal Exploration:
The increased opacification at the left lung base is consistent with pleural effusion and adjacent consolidation, which is likely due to pneumonia. The pleural effusion is located in the left pleural area, and the pneumonia is found in the left lower lobe, based on the location information provided. This finding is confirmed by the interval increase in left lower lobe opacity in the current report, which highlights the progression of these conditions.
