Causal Exploration: The finding of a small right pleural effusion (pleural effusion) is supported by the observation of blunting in the costophrenic angle (Right Pleural, {10, 12}). This suggests an accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which is consistent with the observed blunting on the chest imaging.
