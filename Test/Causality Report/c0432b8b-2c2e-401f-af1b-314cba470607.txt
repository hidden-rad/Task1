Causal Exploration: The patient presents with chest pain (A4) following the smoking of marijuana. The findings (A1) of clear lungs and a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette (A2) indicate that there are no pleural effusions, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum (A3). This suggests that the cause of the chest pain is not related to any acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
