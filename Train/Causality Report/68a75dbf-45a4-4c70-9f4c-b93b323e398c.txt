**FINAL REPORT**

**EXAMINATION:** CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

**INDICATION:** ___ year old man with CHF having desaturations to high 80s // ? worsening pulm edema vs pneumonia?

**COMPARISON:** ___, 06:13

**IMPRESSION:**

As compared to the previous radiograph, centralized pulmonary edema has increased in severity. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. Status post CABG. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumonia.

**Causal Exploration:**
The increased severity of centralized pulmonary edema can be attributed to the abnormally increased density area observed in the lungs. The unchanged moderate cardiomegaly is consistent with a cardiothoracic ratio over 50, indicating the heart's enlarged size. The combination of these findings suggests a progression in the patient's underlying congestive heart failure.
