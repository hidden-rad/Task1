CAUSAL EXPLORATION: 

The finding of low lung volumes (A1) is likely the cause of the accentuation of the cardiomediastinal contours (A2) and bronchovascular crowding (A3). This is further supported by the prominence of the right mediastinal contour being attributed to technical factors rather than an underlying abnormality (A4).
