Causal Exploration:

The evaluation for pneumonia (A1) was conducted due to asymptomatic leukocytosis (A2). The chest radiographs (A3) revealed that the lungs are clear and there is no evidence of effusion or pneumothorax. Given these findings, there is no indication of an acute cardiopulmonary process, despite the initial concern for pneumonia (A4).
