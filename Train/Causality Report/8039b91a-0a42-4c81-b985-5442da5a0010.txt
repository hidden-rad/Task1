Causal Exploration: Based on the examination of the chest (A4), the finding (A1) indicates no signs of pneumonia. The location information (A2 and A3) confirms that the normal lung volumes and the normal size of the cardiac silhouette suggest the absence of pulmonary complications. Therefore, the chest examination results causally explain the patient's lack of pneumonia and other pulmonary issues, despite the new low-grade fever.
