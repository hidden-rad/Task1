Causal Exploration: The finding of pleural effusion (A1) located in the right pleural space (A2) is consistent with the location information {7, 11} (A3). When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting, indicating pleural effusion. The right pleural effusion with known adjacent rib fractures further supports the presence of pleural effusion.
