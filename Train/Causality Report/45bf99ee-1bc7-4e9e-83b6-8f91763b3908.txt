Causal Exploration: The clinical history indicates a fever climbing to 102 degrees, raising concerns about pneumonia. The radiographic findings show normal heart and mediastinal contours with no evidence of focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Given these observations, the absence of an acute intrathoracic process causally explains the lack of pneumonia and other related intrathoracic abnormalities, corroborating the clinical suspicion.
