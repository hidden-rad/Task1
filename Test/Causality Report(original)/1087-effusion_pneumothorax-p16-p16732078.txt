Causal Exploration:
The findings indicate that the heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours, and pulmonary vasculature are normal, leading to the impression of no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. The lungs being clear and the absence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax further support this impression. The normal chest PA and lateral technique confirm the overall healthy state of the chest without any acute osseous abnormalities. Hence, the examination results causally explain the absence of acute issues despite the patient's history of chest tightness.
