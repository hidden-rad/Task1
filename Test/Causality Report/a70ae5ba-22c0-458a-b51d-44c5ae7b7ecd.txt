Causal Exploration:

The finding of right pleural effusion indicates the presence of fluid in the pleural space. Given the location information of the finding in the right pleural area and the history of chest tube placement and removal, it can be inferred that the removal of the catheter may have contributed to the increased size of the pleural effusion. Additionally, the possible new small right apical pneumothorax could have resulted from the procedure or the underlying condition.
