Causal Exploration: The unchanged right basal lung atelectasis could be due to the fact that when both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other. Additionally, when comparing the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area. This increased density area in the right lower lobe (RLL) aligns with the atelectasis finding.
