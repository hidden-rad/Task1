CAUSAL EXPLORATION: The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) indicated in the history is related to the hyperinflation observed in the chest radiograph. This hyperinflation is a characteristic finding in COPD due to airway obstruction. The elevated pulmonary artery pressure inferred from the enlarged hila may be a consequence of chronic hypoxia associated with COPD. The absence of pleural effusion and central adenopathy further supports that the primary issue is chronic airway obstruction rather than an acute infectious process.
