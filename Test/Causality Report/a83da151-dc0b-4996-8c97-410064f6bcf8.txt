CAUSAL EXPLORATION:

 The finding of minimal fluid within the right minor fissure, coupled with the absence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax, supports the impression of no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. This suggests that the symptoms of dyspnea and cough are not due to acute changes in the chest radiograph, correlating with the normal cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours observed.
