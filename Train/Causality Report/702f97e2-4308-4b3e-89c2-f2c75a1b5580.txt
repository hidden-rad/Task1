Causal Exploration:

The persistent increase in heart size observed is indicative of cardiomegaly. The location information of this finding pertains to the Right Atrium, Left Atrium, Right Ventricle, and Left Ventricle. Additionally, the relevant location indices {2, 11} further support the diagnosis. The observed pulmonary edema and potential pericardial effusion are likely consequences of the cardiomegaly, as the enlarged heart can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs and around the heart.
