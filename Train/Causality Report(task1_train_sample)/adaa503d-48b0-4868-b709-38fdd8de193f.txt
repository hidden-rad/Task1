Causal Exploration: The finding of a large mass in the right lower hemithorax corresponds to the location in the right lower lobe. The identification of this mass indicates an abnormally increased density area in the lung zones and is associated with the destruction of adjacent ribs. The presence of smaller nodules in the left lung further supports the diagnosis of a mass rather than other conditions such as pneumonia or cardiac decompensation. Thus, the findings suggest a significant pathological process involving both lungs, with a more pronounced impact on the right lower lobe.
