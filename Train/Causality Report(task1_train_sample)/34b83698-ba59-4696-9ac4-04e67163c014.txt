Causal Exploration:
Finding cardiomegaly indicates the heart is moderately enlarged. The location information of the finding is in the Left Ventricle, with specific reference points at {10, 11}. Assessing cardiac size reveals a cardiothoracic ratio over 50, which is not in the normal range. This enlargement is consistent with the detected cardiomegaly in the Left Ventricle.
