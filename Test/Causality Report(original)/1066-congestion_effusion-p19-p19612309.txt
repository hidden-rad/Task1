Causal Exploration:

The small residual loculated right pleural effusion was identified, indicating the presence of fluid in the right pleural cavity. This finding is located at the right pleural space between the 8th and 10th ribs. The fluid accumulation suggests a persistent localized pleural effusion post-esophagectomy, contributing to the overall chest radiograph findings.
