CAUSAL EXPLORATION:

The presence of a cough (A4) could be contributing to the relatively low lung volumes (A1) identified on the imaging. The mild bibasilar atelectasis (A2) is noted in the lower parts of the lungs (A3), which could be secondary to the low lung volumes and poor aeration frequently associated with coughing.
