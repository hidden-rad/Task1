CAUSAL EXPLORATION:
 
 The interstitial lung disease appears to have progressed since 2 months prior. This is evident by the more pronounced mild interstitial pulmonary abnormality, predominantly micro nodular, observed in the current examination. The suggested repeat CT chest is to further characterize the extent of this progression and evaluate the interstitial lung disease in more detail. The abnormalities are located in the RML, RLL, and LLL regions, as indicated by the findings.
