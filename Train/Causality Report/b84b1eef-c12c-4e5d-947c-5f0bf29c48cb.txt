Causal Exploration:
The progressive elevation of the right lung base is likely due to the increasing small pleural effusion, as indicated by the blunting of the costophrenic angle. The improvement in atelectasis at the bases suggests that the areas of abnormally increased density have resolved, leading to better lung expansion and symmetry.
