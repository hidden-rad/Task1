Causal Exploration:

The moderate left pleural effusion causes blunting of the costophrenic angle, which can lead to subsequent atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Both conditions contribute to asymmetrical lung expansion and abnormal increased density areas in the left lung. The location information of the findings corresponds to the left lower lobe and left pleural region.
