Causal Exploration:
The finding of substantial interval increase in right pleural effusion indicates an accumulation of excess fluid in the pleural space, specifically in the right pleural cavity. Given the patient's condition, the pleural effusion could be due to bleeding or changes in the patient's positioning. The presence of left basal atelectasis further complicates the respiratory status, suggesting partial collapse of the left lung's lower lobe.
