Causal Exploration: The presence of mild pulmonary edema, identified in the right middle lobe (RML) and right lower lobe (RLL) at locations 5 and 12, suggests hemodynamic changes rather than active bleeding. These changes, including the mild pulmonary edema, could be contributing to the observed interval increase in cardiomediastinal caliber.
