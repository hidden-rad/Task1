Causal Exploration:

The presence of pleural effusion (A4) is identified in the MIMIC report as small bilateral effusions. The location of these effusions is found in the left and right pleural spaces (A2) with specific focus on the costophrenic angles (A3). The detection of these effusions (A1) is consistent with the findings of blunting of both costophrenic angles and patchy opacity in the lung bases.
