CAUSAL EXPLORATION:

 The finding that "Cardiac size is normal" and "The lungs are clear" indicates there is no underlying cardiac or pulmonary condition affecting the patient. Additionally, "There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion" shows that the lungs are free of any abnormal air or fluid collections. The proper positioning of the "ET tube" confirms that the respiratory support is correctly administered. Therefore, these findings collectively explain the impression of "No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality."
