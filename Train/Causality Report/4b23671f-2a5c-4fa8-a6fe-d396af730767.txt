Causal Exploration:
The finding of cardiomegaly is supported by the assessment of the cardiac size, where the cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range. The location information relevant to this finding includes the Left Atrium, Right Atrium, Right Ventricle, and Left Ventricle, with measurements indicating a size beyond normal parameters such as aortic knob diameter not exceeding 35cm and right pulmonary artery diameter not more than 20mm. This supports the diagnosis of moderate cardiomegaly in the patient.
