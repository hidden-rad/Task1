Causal Exploration: The moderate right pleural effusion and unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette suggest the presence of pleural effusion and cardiomegaly. These findings correspond to the locations in the right pleural space and the cardiac chambers, including the right atrium, left atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle. The pleural effusion is observed in the right pleural space, while the cardiomegaly is indicated by the unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
