CAUSAL EXPLORATION:

Stable small right pleural effusion was identified, consistent with the malignant pleural effusion noted in the patient's history. The finding of small right pleural effusion correlates with its location in the right pleural space. Additionally, the presence of atelectasis is suggested by the asymmetry and abnormally increased density in the right middle lobe noted in the radiographic assessment. This pleural effusion and atelectasis are consistent with the findings in the right pleural and right middle lobe regions.
