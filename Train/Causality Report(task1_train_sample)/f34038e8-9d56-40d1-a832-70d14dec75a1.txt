Causal Exploration:

The presence of bilateral pleural effusions has led to the adjacent atelectasis observed in the patient's lungs. The costophrenic angle blunting noted is consistent with the pleural effusion. The abnormally increased density in certain lung zones is indicative of atelectasis. Furthermore, the cardiothoracic ratio being within the normal range rules out cardiomegaly as a contributing factor.
